Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\r\n\r\n* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.\r\n* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\r\n* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.\r\n* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\r\n\r\n## Good coding pratices ##\r\n\r\nAccording to Kent Back four rules for a simple system are in order (most important first):\r\n\r\n1. Run all the tests\r\n2. Contain no duplicate code\r\n3. Express all the ideas the author wants to express\r\n4. Minimize classes and methods\r\n\r\nSOLID principles:\r\n\r\n1. Single Responsibility (SRP): ```A class (component) should have one, and only one, reason\r\nto change```.\r\n2. Open-Closed (OCP): ```A system should be open for extension, but closed for\r\nmodification```.\r\n3. Liskov Substitution (LSP): ```Derived types should be substitutable for their base types```.\r\n4. Interface Segregation (ISP): ```Interfaces should be small, focused on a specific use case```.\r\n5. Dependency Inversion (DIP): ```Interfaces should be small, focused on a specific use case```. \r\n\r\nThe DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle states:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvery piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\n- Node 0.10.x.\r\n- grunt-cli: run npm install -g grunt-cli if needed.\r\n- Windows only: remember to set Git and Node path in environment variable %PATH%.\r\n\r\n## Useful Links ##\r\n\r\n### General ###\r\n- [Game of Life (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)\r\n- [Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/)\r\n- [Legacy Code Retreat - Rescuing legacy code without fear](http://legacycoderetreat.typepad.com/)\r\n\r\n### Design ###\r\n- [Principles of Object Oriented Design](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)\r\n- [Is Design Dead? - article by Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html)\r\n- [Don't Repeat Yourself](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself)\r\n- [XP Simplicty Rules](Xp Simplicity Rules)\r\n- [Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design - book by Corey Haines](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign)\r\n- [The Four Elements of Simple Design](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design)\r\n\r\n### ES6 ###\r\n- [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler)\r\n- [An ES6 Module Loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader)\r\n- [Traceur-TodoMVC – a Backbone.js app written with ES6](http://addyosmani.com/blog/traceur-todomvc/)\r\n- [Practical Workflows for ES6 Modules - video by Guy Bedford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VUjM-jJf2U)\r\n- [Practical Workflows for ES6 Modules - article by Guy Bedford](http://guybedford.com/practical-workflows-for-es6-modules)\r\n\r\n### Grunt build tasks ###\r\n- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n- [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/)\r\n- [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)\r\n- [ChaiJS online test suite](http://chaijs.com/api/test/)\r\n- [Sinon docs](http://sinonjs.org/docs/)\r\n- [Grunt basics](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/)\r\n- [How to squeeze the most out of your build configuration](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/tooling/supercharging-your-gruntfile/)\r\n- [Code Coverage of Mocha Tests using Istanbul and Karma](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/12/code-coverage-of-mocha-tests-using-istanbul-and-karma.html)\r\n- [Testing Asynchronous JavaScript](http://martinfowler.com/articles/asyncJS.html)\r\n- [Using r.js to Optimize Your RequireJS Project](http://tech.pro/blog/1639/using-rjs-to-optimize-your-requirejs-project)\r\n\r\n### Libraries ###\r\n- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)\r\n- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)\r\n- [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/docs)\r\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
